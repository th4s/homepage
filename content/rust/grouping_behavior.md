Hi there :wave:, today we want to write a small Rust program and use it to have a look
at some interesting aspects of the language. I think it is cool to develop
something, which is on the one hand of real practical use but on the other hand
is also well suited for demonstration purpose. So the underlying problem should
not be to complicated, that we can focus on Rust and architecture or design
questions.

Luckily :star_struck:, I came across something incredibly annoying when working
on a recent project, where I had to frequently convert between from/to hexadecimal,
bytes and base58.
