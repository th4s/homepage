Alright, here is a little bit about myself. Some time ago I have studied physics, but after graduation
I quickly lost interest, since except from research there is not really a job market for it,
if you are inclined to theory. Then you usually have two options: Either you go into consulting
or you start programming. I tried the first one and it really wasn't for me, so that I ended up doing
computer stuff, and I really like it!

During my consulting job I started with web development front and back, databases, Java, Python, SQL.
After some time I got interested more and more in topics like cryptography, distributed systems,
compilers and systems programming. This was also the time when I quit the job. I started programming
in Rust and would say that today it is the language I feel most comfortable with. Currently I am a
happy Linux user and with every day I am transitioning more and more to computer science and
programming stuff. Check out this awesome [list](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) if you are in a similar
situation.

Today I am working as a research engineer and have a lot to do with distributed systems and cryptography.
If there is anything on your mind, you want to talk about, I would be happy to hear from you!
