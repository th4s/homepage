## A little bit about myself
Some time ago I have studied physics, but after graduation
I quickly lost interest, since except from research there is not really a job market for it,
if you are inclined to theory. Then you usually have two options: Either you go into consulting
or you start programming. I tried the first one and it really wasn't for me, so that I ended up doing
computer stuff, and I really like it!

So my interest for computer stuff I discovered during my consulting job. I started with the usual suspects
like web development front and back, databases, Java, Python, SQL and so on. After some time I got 
interested more and more in topics like cryptography, distributed systems, compilers and systems programming.
I started programming in Rust and would say that today it is the language I feel most comfortable with.

Since, I have been forced to use Linux (thank you very much physics) from the beginning of my studies
the transition to computer science and programming stuff was pretty straightforward. You only have
to [catch up](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) on some undergraduate computer science subjects, but this
is doable given some amount of time and the abundance of free resources.

Today I am working as a research engineer and have a lot to do with distributed systems and cryptography.
If there is anything interesting on your mind, you want to talk about, I would be happy to hear from you!
