Hi there and welcome to my corner of the www. I always wanted to have my own
website but never really knew what sort of content it should be about. Will it
be a blog? If so, what topics should I write about and do I really have the time
to frequently blog about stuff? Lots of unknowns, but I thought it would be
better to just get something up and see how it will work out. Maybe, if there is
already something up, it will be fairly easy to add new content?

Most of the time I will be writing about topics, I encounter during my work or
free time. I just started this website, so there is not a lot of content here,
but I hope this will improve soon.
