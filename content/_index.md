## Hi there,
and welcome to my corner of the www. I have always wanted to have my own website but never really knew 
what sort of content it should be about. Will it be a blog? If so, what topics should I write about
and do I really have the time to frequently blog about stuff? Lots of unknowns, but I thought it 
would be better to just get something up and see how it will work out. Maybe, if there is already 
something, it will be fairly easy to add content?

Most of the time I will be writing about interesting stuff, I encounter during my work or free time,
which is about either [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) or [Rust](https://rust-lang.org),
since I have to do with them in my daily work.

I just started this website, so there is not a lot of content here, but I hope this will improve soon.
